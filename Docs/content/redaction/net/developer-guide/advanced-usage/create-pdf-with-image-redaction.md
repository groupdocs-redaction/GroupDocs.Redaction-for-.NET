In some cases you might need to redact the pages of a document as images, redacting entire areas of the page instead or in addition to a specific text. With GroupDocs.Redaction you can use the following approach:  

*   open the document and apply all required redactions to the document's body (text, annotations, etc.);
    
*   save it as a rasterized PDF file (containing images of the original document's pages);
    
*   apply ImageAreaRedaction to remove specific areas on the pages within the PDF document.  
    
The following example demonstrates how to create a rasterized PDF from a Microsoft Word document and apply image redactions to its pages:

**C#**

```csharp
var stream = new MemoryStream();
// Rasterize the document before applying redactions
using (var redactor = new Redactor("C:\\Temp\\sample.docx"))
{
    // Perform annotation and textual redactions, if needed
    redactor.Save(stream, new RasterizationOptions() { Enabled = true });
    stream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
}
// Re-open the rasterized PDF document to redact its pages as images
using (var redactor = new Redactor(stream))
{
    RedactorChangeLog result = redactor.Apply(new Redactions.ImageAreaRedaction(new System.Drawing.Point(1160, 2375),
        new RegionReplacementOptions(System.Drawing.Color.Aqua, new System.Drawing.Size(1050, 720))));
    if (result.Status != RedactionStatus.Failed)
    {
        using (var fileStream = File.OpenWrite("C:\\Temp\\sample_docx_Raster.pdf"))
        {
            redactor.Save(fileStream, new RasterizationOptions() { Enabled = false });
        }
    }
}
```

Please, note that you don't have to use GroupDocs.Redaction to create a rasterized PDF from an office document. You will be able to use it, if you don't have any other tool for that.
