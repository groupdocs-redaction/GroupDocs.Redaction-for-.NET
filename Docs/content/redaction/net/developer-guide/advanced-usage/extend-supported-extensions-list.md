This method can be used when for some reason files have non-standard extensions or if its format is supported, but not pre-configured. For instance, all kinds of plain text files (logs, dumps etc) could be opened with text processors like MS Word/Open Office. In this case you do not need to create your own format handler. As it is shown below, you can add file extension (e.g. ".log") as being handled by the same *[DocumentFormatInstance](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/redaction/groupdocs.redaction.integration/documentformatinstance)* as MS Word files:

**C#**

```csharp
var config = RedactorConfiguration.GetInstance();
var docxSettings = config.FindFormat(".docx");
docxSettings.ExtensionFilter = docxSettings.ExtensionFilter + ",.log";
using (Redactor redactor = new Redactor(@"C:\sample.log"))
{
   // Here we can use document instance to perform redactions
}
```

In detail, creating your own document format instances is covered in another article.
