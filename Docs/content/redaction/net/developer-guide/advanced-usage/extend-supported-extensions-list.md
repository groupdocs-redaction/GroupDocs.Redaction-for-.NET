This method can be used when for some reason files have non-standard extensions or if its format is supported, but not pre-configured. For instance, all kinds of plain text files (batch, command files, etc.) could be opened. In this case you do not need to create your own format handler. As it is shown below, you can add file extension (e.g. ".dump") as being handled by the same *[DocumentFormatInstance](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/redaction/groupdocs.redaction.integration/documentformatinstance)* as all plain text files:

**C#**

```csharp
var config = RedactorConfiguration.GetInstance();
var settings = config.FindFormat(".txt");
settings.ExtensionFilter = settings.ExtensionFilter + ",.dump";
using (Redactor redactor = new Redactor(@"C:\sample.dump"))
{
   // Here we can use the document instance to perform redactions
}
```

In detail, creating your own document format instances is covered in another article.
